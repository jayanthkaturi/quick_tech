- You have win 10 sys
- install linux as second OS on the system
- reboot will boot to win 10 directly!
- install [EasyBCD](https://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/) tool.
- [Add linux to boot options](https://askubuntu.com/a/140376)
- reboot and choose linux
- run ```bash sudo grub-install /dev/sda ```, assuming sda is your harddisk
  - if you don't know, run sudo fdisk -l and see beside which dev partition the * is.
  - /dev/sda is the first internal hard drive, so it'll be /dev/sda most **caution** probably.
- Rebooting should give grub.
- If you select windows you'll see linux option again, cause we added it in the 4th step.
  - To remove this, boot to windows
  - remove linux entry created in step 5.
- Be happy!
