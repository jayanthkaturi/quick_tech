## Correlation Coefficients

```
Pearson coefficient:

Draw a straight line fit in scatter plot. The line is the one that minimizes the square distances between
the line and the points. The slope (up + or down -) will be sign of the correlation. Compare scatter along yaxis
and along the scatter line. If yaxis > scatter line: strong correlation coefficient else: weak.

pearson coeff = (SP(cross product of deviation)) / (sqrt(ssx)*sqrt(ssy))
ssx -> sum of squares of deviations

Point Biserial:
Dichotomous variable categrical (one hot encode) and continous, calc pearson coeff
